The goal of this project is to predict life expectancy based on factors such as demographic, socio economic, immunization and other health factors. The analysis will also aim at answering questions like what are the actual number of variables affecting life expectancy. What changes should a country with low life expectancy implement to improve the life span of its citizens?
